       <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1777, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon posed the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have a floor made of parallel wooden boards, each the same width, and we drop a needle onto the floor. What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line between two boards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He solved it with some fancy calculus, which is a fine way of doing it, but not particularly satisfying to me. However in 1860 a man named Joseph-Ã‰mile Barbier came up with this super slick proof, which is without a doubt the coolest proof I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is that rather than trying to calculate the probability directly, Barbier examined it through the lens of the expected number of lines the needle would cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we define our boards to be 1 unit of distance wide, and we find that dropping a needle of length 1 unit has a probability $$p$$ of crossing one of the lines. We will ignore the possibility of the needle being exactly along a line, or having one end each on precisely two lines, since the probability of those is 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we drop one needle $$n_1$$, our expected number of crossings is simply $$p$$, the probability that the needle crosses a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we drop a second needle $$n_2$$, then by linearity of expectation we find that our expected total number of crossings is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$E(n_1+n_2)=E(n_1)+E(n_2)=2p$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the expected number of crossings when you drop $$m$$ needles is $$mp$$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;two-needles.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Two needles&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two needles on the floor&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if we drop a needle $$n$$ and break it into $$m$$ identical pieces $$n_1 \ldots n_m$$ we find that each piece must be responsible for the same expected number of crossings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$E(n) = \sum_{i=0}^{m}E(n_i) \implies E(n_i)=\frac{1}{p}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we can drop a needle of any length $$\ell$$ we want and the expected number of crossings will be $$\ell p$$. This holds even if we drop some really bizarre needles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;strange-needles.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Strangely shaped needles&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some strangely shaped needles&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now suppose we take a needle and bend it into a circle of diameter 1. We know that the expected number of crossings must be $$\pi p$$ from before. But consider the ways the needle could fall on the floor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;circle-needles.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Some needles bent into circles&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Three needles, bent into circles&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It always crosses in exactly two places! So $$\pi p=2$$ and we find that $$p=\frac{2}{\pi}$$. Any straight needle we drop on the floor will have probability $$\frac{2\ell}{\pi}$$ of crossing a line. And we didn&amp;rsquo;t do a single bit of calculus!&lt;/p&gt;
